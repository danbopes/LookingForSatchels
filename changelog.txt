2015-12-11 LFS v0.1
* initial upload

2015-12-12 LFS v0.2
* now remembers roles and watch list between sessions

2015-12-19 LFS v0.3
* New option to show a popup when a satchel has been found. The popup lets you queue for that dungeon without the need to click through the Blizzard UI.
* While in combat or in a group, the popup will be shown after leaving combat/leaving the group. (can't solo queue while in RaidFinder)
* The popup will hide again on its own, if you won't get a satchel for a dungeon.
* Use shift+click on a popup button to queue/not queue AND remove that dungeon from your watch list. Might be useful if you only want to do each RaidFinder wing once a week.
* New right-click interaction with the search status indicator: Rescan all instances (use if you declined a popup by accident)
* Keep the feedback coming!
